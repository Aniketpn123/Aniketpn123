### Hi there ### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>
I'm Aniket — a mechanical engineer learning to code and create.  

Currently exploring **web development** and **Java**, and building small projects to improve my skills.  
I enjoy learning new tech, making simple things work, and seeing progress bit by bit.  

Outside of coding, I love making beats 🎧 and exploring creativity through music and sound.
