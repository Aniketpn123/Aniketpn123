# Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/aniket-nakhate/icons/blob/main/wave.gif" width="24" alt="wave" />
I'm **Aniket** — a mechanical engineer learning to code and create.

Currently exploring **Web Development** and **Java**, and building small projects to sharpen my skills.  
I enjoy learning new tech, making simple things work, and seeing progress bit by bit.

Outside of coding, I love making **beats** <img src="https://github.com/aniket-nakhate/icons/blob/main/headphones.png" width="20" alt="beats" /> and exploring creativity through music and sound.
