### Hi there!
I'm Aniket — a mechanical engineer learning to code and create.  

Currently exploring **web development** and **Java**, and building small projects to improve my skills.  
I enjoy learning new tech, making simple things work, and seeing progress bit by bit.  

Outside of coding, I love making beats 🎧 and exploring creativity through music and sound.
