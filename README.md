### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Aniket Nakhate**](#), a mechanical engineer exploring code, creativity, and everything in between.

Currently, I’m learning **Web Development** and **Java**, building projects to sharpen my skills and understand real-world systems.  
I'm fascinated by how technology connects ideas — from a simple script to a full-fledged app that makes life easier.

Outside of coding, I create **beats 🎧**, explore sound design, and enjoy experimenting with creativity in music and visuals.

#### Let's connect!
